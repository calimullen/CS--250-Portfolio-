How do I interpret needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

-	When designing a system for a client. The client is the number one factor in all decisions being made about the system’s design.
The client is the main user of the system, and everything needs to be exactly how they intended so they can use the system to its maximum
capacity. User stories provide another opportunity for the client to voice specific concerns and specifications. It also gives the
development team a better understanding of what the client is looking for, and what the system will be used for. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I plan to incorporate into my future work?

-	Personally, I love the fluidity that agile brings to the development process. When beginning a new project, I like to take my time
when planning and organizing the client specifications and the system design. I like to break things up into sections, or sprints to have
a better understanding of the work to be completed. These sprints are broken down by size, length of completion, or difficulty overall.

What does it mean to be a good team member in development?

-	Being a good team member in development means being flexible and professional. Having the ability to move around and help in the areas
that need can improve the team’s performance. Being aware of the team around you is important as well. For example, if I was working on a
specific section of code, I would leave notes and explanations to my work for testers and maintenance to know where they are supposed to
look in the code.
